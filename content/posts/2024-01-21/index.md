This is just a quick documentation of the day I got **my first fly fishing rod**.
It's nothing special, just a Redington Crosswater rod and reel from Amazon for $97.74, but I am so excited.
It's still very much the middle of winter here in Boston with short, cold days, but I am looking forward to getting out in the spring to start my new hobby.
