I returned this morning to Jamaica Pond with the primary goal of finding the Wooly Bugger I lost [yesterday]({{< ref "/posts/2024-02-03" >}}).
Took a few minutes of shuffling in the freezing cold, but I eventually found my fly.

With the primary objective accomplished, I decided it was worth trying my hand at casting practice again since the wind was relatively calm.
So I strung up the rod, tied in my Bugger, and gave it another go.

It's worth noting that I could barely feel my hands, and what I could feel was painful, but I think I did better than yesterday.
First, I was able to slow down a little, and get a few good false casts.
I was more composed, letting the line travel further before moving the rod in the other direction.
Second, I was more conservative about the amount of line I took from the reel, choosing instead to start with a shorter line.
This helped me focus on better form to begin with.
Finally, I recorded a bit of my practice so I could watch it back later and compare to online tutorials.
Watching it from my (warmer) apartment afterwards, it wasn't pretty, but it was helpful to see my posture, how my arms were moving, and how the rod traveled.

I'm happy to have gotten in some practice, but I cannot wait for warmer weather.
